Here is a multi-tenant application built with Next.js and Supabase.

Currently the app has the following features:
- Authentication with email and password and magic links from Supabase
- A simple dashboard layout with navigation to see all tickets, a form to create a new ticket and a user list
- Plus a password recovery feature that sends a recovery link to the user's email address
- With protected routes that require authentication
- Added Multi Tenant support
